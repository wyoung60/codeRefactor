# Code Refactor

## The Repository

Repository was created to fix nav bar bugs, add semantic elements in place of div tags to add more description to the code, and consolidate the css code.

## Code Correction

Search engine optimization nav need "id" added to section tag to follow href in list.  Added "alt" tags to images in html.

## Semantic elements

Changed all div tags to semantic elements making code easier to follow with more descriptive name.

## CSS code

Used the semantic elements to eliminate the use of some created classes using element type selectors for styling.  Consolidated classes performing the same operations to one and updated the html file to reflect.  Reorganized to follow html flow.

## Lessons Learned

Classes are powerful elements that can be created to work across multiple lines of code and could easily be used in excess.
